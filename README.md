# Icarus-Aviation
An airlines booking python program 
sorry for this i went back to home and forgot about this until i saw the group chat msg that said time extended till 2am, this is my own past project that i built 
i don't know why i thought the deadline was 24 november, this is my first time using git hub sorry for my misconduct 
sorry again as time is short i might be copying and pasting it to my other projrcts that i just now added..
